1. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?
1A. 7 iterations

2. Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?
2A. 3 iterations

3. Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.
fib(0) = 0
fib(1) = 1
fib(2) = 0 + 1 = 1
fib(3) = 1 + 1 = 2
fib(4) = 1 + 2 = 3
fib(5) = 2 + 3 = 5
fib(6) = 3 + 5 = 8
fib(7) = 5 + 8 = 13
fib(8) = 8 + 13 = 21
fib(9) = 13 + 21 = 34
fib(10) = 21 + 34 = 55
fib(11) = 34 + 55 = 89
fib(12) = 55 + 89 = 144

4. Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
4A. Linear Search with iterative solution.
- This is because Binary Search only works on sorted collections, and that the iterative solution is faster than the recursive one.

5. Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
5A. Binary Search with iterative solution.
- Binary Search is much faster in a sorted collection than that of Linear Search, and that iterative solution is faster than the recursive one.
